#creating the non existing tables in the database
#we use the metadata attribute of our declarative base class to create the non existing tables
Base.metadata.create_all(engine) #we have to provide the engine of the database as a reference we want to refer to

#the __init__() method
#
#Our User class, as defined using the Declarative system, has been provided with a constructor (e.g. __init__() method) which automatically accepts keyword names that match the columns weâ€™ve mapped. We are free to define any explicit __init__() method we prefer on our class, which will override the default method provided by Declarative.

#orm will talk to the database using the Session handle. Here is How. Whenever we need to do something in the database we need a Session object to that database

#either use
# Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine) #or we can use

Session = sessionmaker() #we define a Session class which will be used as the factory to create the session objects
Session.configure(bind=engine) #engine already created earlier, now configure the session to use that engine

#create a session
session = Session()
#add the user to the database, basically the insert command

foo_user = User(name="foo", full_name="foo_bar",nick_name="foo_bar_nick_name")

#now adding the addresses to the user foo

foo_user.addresses = [
Address(email_address="foo@hotmail.com"),
Address(email_address="foobar@hitmail.com"),
]

#adding the changes to the database
session.add(foo_user)
session.commit()

#filter the user foo and get it addresses
foo = session.query(User).filter_by(name="foo").first()
print("foo: %s"%foo)
print("foo addresses: %s"%foo.addresses)
